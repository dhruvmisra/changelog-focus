# Allowed hosts for scraping changelog

Changelog Focus allows scraping changelog content **only** from these hosts:

- readthedocs.io
- konghq.com
- kubernetes.io
- docker.com
- hashicorp.com

This restriction has been added to prevent scraping any malicious or sensitive host.

## Contributing more host names

In case you wish to add a website host which should be allowed, please follow these [contributing guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-new-hosts-to-allow-scraping).

> NOTE: Please refrain from adding any personal websites.
